The goal is to compare the efficiency between wifi Halow communication and simple wifi communication to build a multi-hop network using drones.



We use droneKit and droneKit SITL to simulate the drones 

The code is meant to be launch by running GCS-T.py

Best way to run this code is by running it in the virtual machine of this repo (image disk : )

Repo for the work of Thomas CADALEN and Paul CHOCHILLON during their intership at the University Polytecnica de Catalunya
