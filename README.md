The goal is to compare the efficiency between wifi Halow communication and simple wifi communication to build a multi-hop network using drones.

We use droneKit and droneKit SITL to simulate the drones 

## Setup the environment 
You first have to download the image disk of the virutal machine you have to use to run your tests.

A mission planner connection list is generated in /mnt/hgfs/connect/ , our advise is to use this folder as shared folder with the host. Doing so will facilitate the access to the file for giving it to mission planner 


## Launching the simulation

The code is meant to be launch by running GCS-T.py
In GCS-T.py, global varaibles at the beggining of the code allows you to easily change some parameters, like the path to the shared folder, the number of drones to use in the simulation, if the drones have an Halow interface or if you want to print all the logs in terminal
